Manabi Mentor is a collection of prompts to be pasted in to a LLM. These are designed to be used with Cure Dolly's Organic Japanese course found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSvH9vH60Ig&list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj). 


## Instructions
 - Open up the lesson you want to follow
 - Copy and paste the prompt in the text box from where it says *COPY FROM HERE*
 - ...that's it, Manabi Mentor will guide you the rest of the way!

NOTE: **Manabi Mentor is only tested with GPT-4**. Currently, this is available with a ChatGPT subscription. Other LLMs have not been tested. Expect worse/unusable performance with other LLMs.
