Manabi Mentor is a collection of prompts to be pasted in to a LLM. These are designed to be used with Cure Dolly's Organic Japanese course found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSvH9vH60Ig&list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj). 


## Instructions
 - Open up the lesson you want to follow
 - Copy and paste the prompt in the text box from where it says **COPY FROM HERE**
 - Manabi Mentor *should* ask you whether you want your Japanese in kana, or kana and romaji
 - After telling Manabi Mentor your preferences, watch the lecture. Talk about it while you're watching it, or when you finished it, or when you're rewatching it. Manabi Mentor wants you to fully take in what you're watching, and can help rephrase complex topics
 - Once you're finished, tell Manabi Mentor "Video complete" or something like that. Manabi Mentor will move on to the exercises. Or if you feel you can move straight on to the exercises, you can mention that you've finished the video when you're setting your kana preferences
 - Each video has a few tailored exercises for you to work through. Once you finish these, you can ask Manabi Mentor for more if you want

NOTE: **Manabi Mentor is only tested with GPT-4**. Currently, this is available with a ChatGPT subscription. Other LLMs have not been tested. Expect worse/unusable performance with other LLMs. 

## FAQ
Q: **Manabi Mentor didn't do what it was supposed to (e.g. it didn't ask me for kana preferences, it dumped all the exercises at once)**
A: Just regenerate the response or ask Manabi Mentor directly to fix it. 

Q: **I don't like the exercises that Manabi Mentor is setting me**
A: Just ask for different ones

Q: **Why isn't this a plugin for GPT4 instead?**
A: I don't have dev access to it lol
