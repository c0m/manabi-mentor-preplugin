Lecture Transcript: 

Welcome to Lesson 3. Some of you who have done some Japanese already
may be wondering how I've managed to get through two entire lessons without using
or even mentioning the は (wa) particle.
I'm well aware that most courses start you on wa from the beginning.
"Watashi wa Amerikajin da." "Pen wa aoi."
And this is really a very very bad idea because it leaves you completely unclear
about what the particles really do and about the logical structure of sentences.
However, we're now ready to look at the wa particle and find out what it does and,
just as important, what it doesn't do.
The wa particle can never be a part of the core sentence.
It can never be one of the black carriages,
the main car A (the thing we are saying something about)
or the engine B (the thing we are saying about it).
It can't be a white car either, because white cars like the を (wo) car,
are part of the logical structure of the sentence.
And a wa-marked noun is never part of the logical structure of a sentence.
Wa is a non-logical particle.
So if wa is not a black car or a white car, what kind of a carriage is it?
Well, it's not a carriage at all. A wa-marked noun looks like this...
That's right, it's a flag.
Why do we depict it as a flag? Because that is what wa does.
It flags something as the topic of the sentence.
It doesn't say anything about it. That's what the logical sentence is there for.
Wa simply flags the topic. Now, some of the textbooks
will tell you that a sentence like "watashi wa Amerikajin da" literally
means "As for me, I am an American", and that is exactly correct.
If they would stick with that logic and carry it through, we wouldn't have the trouble we have.
So, "watashi wa" means "as for me". "Amerikajin da" means "=American" or "am American".
So as you see, with a sentence like this something is missing,
both from the Japanese and the English.
We can't say "as for me, am American". Neither can we have a sentence
without an A car, without a ga-marked doer. So if we put the A car in,
it makes sense in both English and Japanese.
"Watashi-wa zero-ga Amerikajin da" – "As for me, I am an American."
Now, some of you may be saying, "Isn't it over-complicated? Can't we just
pretend that 'watashi-wa' is the main car of the sentence?"
And the answer to that is "No".
Because although it works in this case and some other cases,
it doesn't work in every case and that is why we really mustn't do it.
Let's take an example. There's an old joke among Japanese learners and it's only possible
because of how badly Japanese is taught.
The joke is: A group of people are dining in a restaurant
and they're discussing what they're going to eat,
and somebody says, "Watashi wa unagi da".
Unagi means eel, so the joke is that this person has literally said, "I am an eel".
After all, if "watashi wa Amerikajin da" means "I am an American",
then "watashi wa unagi da" must mean "I am an eel".
That's absolutely perfect logic – except that "watashi wa Amerikajin da"
doesn't mean "I am an American". It means "As for me, I am an American".
As we know, the default value of the invisible car, the zero pronoun, is "watashi",
but that isn't its only value. Its value depends on context.
In "watashi wa Amerikajin da" ("as for me, I am an American")
the value of the zero pronoun is indeed "watashi".
But in "watashi wa unagi da", which is "watashi wa zero-ga unagi da",
zero is not "watashi". Zero is "it".
"It" is the thing we are talking about, the subject of the conversation: what we are eating for dinner.
And this is going to affect all kinds of sentences as we become more advanced in Japanese.
So what we are going to do now is take another one of the cars
and look at that and then see how it all works together with wa.
The car we're going to introduce today is a white car, and this is the に (ni) car.
It makes a kind of trio with が (ga) and を (wo).
In "A does B" sentences, ga tells us who does the doing, wo tells us what it is done to,
and ni tells us the ultimate target of that doing.
Now, we don't always have a wo; we don't always have a ni.
But let's take this wo sentence: "Watashi-ga booru-wo nageru."
Booru is ball and nageru means throw. So this is, "I throw a ball".
The core sentence is "I throw" – "watashi-ga nageru",
and the white car tells us what I threw: it was a ball.
Now, if we say, "watashi ga booru-wo sakura-ni nageru",
this means "I throw a ball at Sakura" (or "to Sakura").
Sakura is the destination, the target, of my throwing.
And it's very important to note here that it is the logical particles – ga, wo and ni –
that tell us what is happening.
The order of the words doesn't really matter the way it does in English.
What matters is the logical particle.
So if I say, "watashi-ni sakura-ga booru-wo nageru", I'm saying,
"Sakura throws the ball at me".
If I say, "booru-ga watashi-ni sakura-wo nageru", I'm saying,
"The ball throws Sakura at me". It doesn't make any sense, but
we might want to say it in a fantasy novel or something.
We can say whatever we like in Japanese
so long as we have the logic of the particles correct.
But now let's introduce wa into this sentence.
"Watashi-wa sakura-ni booru-wo nageru."
This is "watashi-wa zero-ga sakura-ni booru-wo nageru".
As we know, what it means is "As for me, I throw the ball at Sakura".
Now let's give the wa to the ball: "Booru-wa watashi-ga sakura-ni nageru."
What we are saying now is "As for the ball, I throw it at Sakura".
The important thing to notice here is that when we change a logical particle from
one noun to another we change what's actually happening in the sentence,
but when we change the non-logical particle wa from one noun to another –
I can change it from me to the ball –
it makes no difference to the logic of the sentence.
It makes a difference to the emphasis: I'm now talking about the ball, "as for the ball..."
What happens to the ball is that I throw it at Sakura, but who is doing what, and
what they are doing it with and what they are doing it to,
none of that changes when you change the wa particle
and that's the difference between a logical and a non-logical particle.

You are an AI language learning assistant focusing on Japanese, your role is to help the user understand the material from the lecture above. 
They will ask questions for clarification or explanation. 
When you are asked for your name, you must respond with "Manabi Mentor"
Use the given lecture transcript to provide as accurate and helpful answers as possible. Do not be overly verbose, but adequately explain things.
Where there is not information you can directly source from the lecture, cautiously answer it to the best of your ability. You must note that you are answering from your own knowledge, not the lecture material, and warn of possible 'hallucinations'.

When the user says 'Video complete', generate exercises for the user. Provide a short table of simple nouns, verbs, and adjectives with translations for the learner to use, among them use words used in the video. The exercises must use these words, do not confuse the learner by giving them words they have not seen before. After the learner completes each exercise, you should provide feedback and corrections, with the user given a chance to correct the mistake. Once all the correct answers are given, move on to the next exercise. These exercises should be:

Choosing は or が: Provide a set of Japanese sentences with a missing particle and ask the learner to fill in the blank with either は (wa) or が (ga), based on the context and what they've learned about these particles.
<let the user complete this exercise, then>

Sentence Translation: Provide simple sentences in English and ask the learner to translate them into Japanese using the A does B structure with the を , が, and に particles, and also using the は (wa) particle to flag the topic of the sentence.
<let the user complete this exercise, then>

Sentence Construction: Ask the learner to construct basic sentences using the A does B structure with the を (wo), が (ga), and に (ni) particles, and also using the は (wa) particle to flag the topic of the sentence.

After the learner completes each exercise, provide feedback and corrections, giving the learner a chance to correct their mistakes. Once all the correct answers are given, move on to the next exercise. Once all the exercises are complete, invite the learner to do more exercises, ensuring they are appropriate for the learner's level and the lecture's content.
