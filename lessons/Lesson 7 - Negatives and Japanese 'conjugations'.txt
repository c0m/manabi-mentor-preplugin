Today we're going to talk about negatives.
And in order to do that we're going to have to introduce one of the fundamental secrets of Japanese
that the schools and textbooks almost never tell you.
And it makes the whole of Japanese much much easier.
But before we get to that, let's look at the fundamental basis of Japanese negatives.
The fundamental basis of negatives is the adjective "nai".
This adjective means "non-exist / not-be".
The word for "exist" for any object, any inanimate thing, the sky, the sea, the universe,
a grain of rice, a flower, a tree, anything, is "aru".
So, if we want to say, "There is a pen / A pen exists", we say "pen-ga aru".
But if we want to say there isn't a pen, we say "pen-ga nai".
Now, why do we use a verb for being and an adjective for non-being?
Because this happens throughout Japanese.
Whenever we DO something we use a verb.
Whether we walk, or sing, or run, or anything – that's a verb.
But if we don't do it, then we attach "nai" to the verb and that becomes the engine of the sentence.
So when we say we're not doing something, we're not using a verb, we're using an adjective.
Why is that?
Because Japanese is very logical.
When we do something, an action is taking place.
That's a verb.
But when we don't do it, no action is taking place and we are describing a state of non-action.
So, that's an adjective.
All right.
So, if we want to say, "There is no pen", we say "pen-ga nai."
But what if we want to say, "This is not a pen"?
That's not quite the same thing, is it?
So, how do we say that?
If we want to say "There is a pen", as we know, we say
"kore-wa ("kore" – "this")... kore-wa pen-da".
"As for this, pen = / As for this, it's a pen."
But if we want to say, "This is not a pen", we say, "kore-wa, pen-de-wa nai".
So what does that mean?
Well, the "de" is the te-form of "da" or "desu".
So we still have "kore-wa pen-da" in the form of "kore-wa pen-de" and then we're attaching "nai".
So what we're saying is, "As for this, as for being a pen, it isn't / This is not a pen".
All right.
So now let's move on to the largest part of this question, which is verbs.
In order to put a verb into the negative, we have to attach "nai",
and we do this by attaching it to the a-stem.
What does that mean?
Well, let's look at the stem system.
The Japanese verb-stem system is the simplest, the most logical and the most beautiful
verb transformation system in this world.
It's almost absolutely regular.
Once you know how to do it, you can make any transformation (except for
the te- and ta-form, which you already know).
But the schools and textbooks don't tell you this.
Instead of telling you this, they present each "conjugation", as they call it
(and they aren't in fact conjugations)...
they present each one as a separate case
with separate rules which appear to be random.
And because they don't tell you the fundamental logic of the whole system, and because they
describe the changes that take place as if they were really written in the Roman alphabet
when they are written in kana, it really looks like that.
Students really think they have to treat each case as a separate case
and learn separate rules in every case.
And you don't have to.
You just have to know the stem system.
So let's look at it.
As we've already learned, every verb ends in one of the u-row kana.
And I'm turning the chart on its side here for reasons you'll see in a moment.
So these kana in the red box are the ones that can end a verb.
It's not every u-row kana, but it's most of them.
So we have verbs like "kau" (buy), "kiku" (hear), "hanasu" (speak), "motsu" (hold) etc.
Now, as you can see, there are four other possible ways in which a verb could end.
And each of those four ways is used, and they are called the verb-stems.
Today we are only going to look at the a-stem, because that's the one we need for the negative.
So, to form the a-stem, we simply shift the last kana of the verb from the u-row to the a-row.
So "kiku" (hear) becomes "kika", "hanasu" (speak) becomes "hanasa",
"motsu" (hold) becomes "mota", and so forth.
There's only one exception in this system – and when I say that I mean the whole system,
all the stems – there's only this one exception, which is that when a word ends in the u-kana
the stem doesn't change to "-a", it changes to "-wa".
So the negative of "kau" is not "kaanai", it's "kawanai".
And it's only in the a-stem that we have this exception, so that's the only exception in
the whole system, and I think you can see why it exists:
"kaanai" is not as easy to say as "kawanai", is it?
All the others are perfectly regular.
"Kiku" (hear) becomes "kikanai" (not-hear); "hanasu" (speak) becomes "hanasanai" (not-speak);
"motsu" (hold) becomes "motanai" (not hold), and so forth.
And as we already know, with ichidan verbs, they only ever drop that "-ru" and put on
whatever we want to put on, so "taberu" (eat) becomes "tabenai" (not-eat).
And that's it.
That's how we turn any verb negative.
It's very, very simple.
Now, what about adjectives?
How do we make adjectives negative?
Well, when we make a transformation to an adjective,
what we always do is we turn the "-i" on the end of it into "-ku":
"akai" (is-red) becomes "akaku"; "kawaii" (is-cute) becomes
"kawaiku"; kowai (is-scary) becomes "kowaku".
And this is the way we make the te-form of adjectives: "akaku" becomes "akakute".
And it's also the way we make the negative: "akai" becomes "akakunai" (not-red).
Now interestingly, this -ku is the opposite of what happens in the te-form, isn't it?
If a word ends in -ku, in the te-form we turn that -ku into -i.
But in an adjective we turn the -i into -ku.
If we want to put an adjective into the past tense, we take off the -i and use -katta.
So "kowai" (is-scary) becomes "kowakatta" (was-scary).
And because "nai" is also an i-adjective, when we put that into the past we also say "nakatta".
So, if we want to say "Sakura runs", we say "Sakura-ga hashiru"; if we want to say "Sakura
doesn't run", we say "Sakura-ga hashira nai"; if we want to say "Sakura ran (in the past)",
we say "Sakura-ga hashitta" – because it's a godan verb; and if we want to say "Sakura
didn't run (in the past)", we say "Sakura-ga hashira nakatta".
"Hashira nai", and then we put "nai" into the past: "hashira nakatta".
Now, as we all know.
"Sakura-ga hashiru" is rather unnatural Japanese, just as it's rather unnatural English.
We say "Sakura is running" in Englsh, and in Japanese we say "Sakura-ga hashitte iru".
So if we want to put all that in the past, what do we do?
Well, all we have to do is put that "iru" into the past.
So we say "Sakura-ga hashitte ita" – "Sakura was running".
And if we want to say "Sakura wasn't running", we say "Sakura-ga hashitte i-nakatta".
That "iru" is a simple ichidan verb, so we just drop the -ru and put on ta or nai and,
in the past, nakatta.
I always say that Japanese is like Lego.
Once you know the basic building blocks you can build anything.
And there are almost no exceptions in Japanese.
In the whole of what we've been talking about today there are really just two exceptions.
And I'm going to introduce those so that you know everything you need to know.
The only real exception to every verb being made negative by adding "nai" is the verb
"masu", which is a helper verb that makes words formal.
We add it to the i-stem of a verb, and we will look at the i-stem later, but I think
you can already guess what it is.
So, "hanasu" becomes "hanashimasu", "kiku" becomes "kikimasu" and so on.
When you put "masu" into the negative, it does not become "masanai", as you would expect
– it becomes "masen".
Because it's formal, it's a bit old-fashioned and it uses the old Japanese negative "sen"
instead of "nai".
The only other apparent exception is that "ii" , the adjective "ii", which means "is-good",
has an older form, "yoi", which is still used quite often.
And when we make any transformation to "ii", it turns back to "yoi", so in the past tense
we don't say "ikatta", we say "yokatta" – and if you've seen much anime you've probably
heard this quite often.
"Yokatta", literally "zero-ga yokatta" – "It was good / That turned out well / That's great".
And if you want to say something is not good, you don't say "ikunai", you say "yokunai".
And those are the only exceptions.

You are an AI language learning assistant focusing on Japanese, your role is to help the user understand the material from the lecture above.
They will ask questions for clarification or explanation.
When you are asked for your name, you must respond with "Manabi Mentor"
Use the given lecture transcript to provide as accurate and helpful answers as possible. Do not be overly verbose, but adequately explain things.
Where there is not information you can directly source from the lecture, cautiously answer it to the best of your ability. You must note that you are answering from your own knowledge, not the lecture material, and warn of possible 'hallucinations'.

Once you have receieved and understood these instructions, you must first say "Note the correction from Cure Dolly in the video's pinned comment!", then continue by asking the user whether they would like your Japanese text to have kana, or kana and romaji. When you get a reply, tell the user that their preference is understood, and tell them to say "Video complete" when they want to move on to exercises. After that, they will begin asking you questions.

When the user says 'Video complete', generate exercises for the user. Provide a short list of simple nouns, verbs, and 5 adjectives with translations for the learner to use. The exercises must use these words, do not confuse the learner by giving them words they have not seen before. After the learner completes each exercise, you should provide feedback and corrections, with the user given a chance to correct the mistake. Once all the correct answers are given, move on to the next exercise. These exercises should be:

Negation practice: Give the user 6 simple sentences. 2 end in godan verbs, 2 end in ichidan verbs, 2 end in adjectives. The user is tasked with providing the negative versions of these sentences. 

Quiz: Identify whether the 5 given sentences are in their correct negative form. If not, correct them.
